- Public variables/properties: PascalCase
- Private fields: camelCase
- No underscores in names
- No abbreviations (use full descriptive names)
- No single-line if statements
- No ternary operators (always replace them with if/else)
- Extract complex conditionals into named methods
- Methods should do one thing
- No magic numbers
- If you see comments, replace with a method call so it's self-documenting
- Order methods by access level (public, private, protected)
- Enum types should always have Type at the end of their name (e.g. ColorType instead of Color)
- Boolean variables should be named with a verb (e.g. isEnabled instead of enabled), prefer use of is, has, can, should
- Always put if/else statements on a new line and surround them with braces
- Don't use private [SerializeField]s.  Make them public and use the inspector to set them.
- When converting private SerializedFields to public, make sure to capitalize the first letter of the variable name.
